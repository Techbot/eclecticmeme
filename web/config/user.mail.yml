  body: "[user:display-name],\r\n\r\nYo . It's great that you registered. It's even better that this email got to you. That's assuming it got to you. Most likely it didn't because Gmail hates me. That's why I'm trying to make this email more personable.\r\n\r\nThank you for registering at [site:name]. Your application for an account is currently pending approval. \r\nOnly because the player profile and the user profile are two different objects. I need to make a rule that when one is created so is the other. But I'll do that after Gmail start accepting my emails.\r\n\r\nOnce it has been approved, you will receive (or not) another email containing information about how to log in, set your password, and other details.\r\n\r\n--  [site:name] team"

There was no need for them.\r\n\r\n But somewhere between then and now, people started wondering. Who am I? Where do I come from? Where am I going? And they came up with answers. And they came up with beginnings. But of course, everybody had different answers, because everybody had a different beginning (Or was it the other way round?). You see, the alternative was to assume that there was no beginning and that we are swirling in a mass of chaos with no answers, with no objective reference point from which to gauge, on which to gauge, eh........... everything. That's all one would need, one tiny objective reference point, and everything would be okay.\r\n\r\n'God, Heaven, the Creation, the Big Bang, an atom, a quark, a platonic universe, Hyper-space, Jesus, Buddha, the Sun, the Earth, Sacred Places, Agartha, The Grail, The Ark, The Philosopher's Stone, the Soul, Gravity, Time and Space...All failed the test.\r\n\r\n Because, of course, the truth is there are no absolutes.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nYour account at [site:name] has been activated.
